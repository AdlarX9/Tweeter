# Tweeter React Native

Tweeter React Native is a native iOS and Android interface inspired by Twitter, functioning with the `tweeter-api`.

It allows users to post and receive messages in real-time.

The app is built using Expo, which is a framework for React Native. To get started, simply install the JavaScript packages using npm and Expo, start an emulator, and run the following command:
```bash
expo start
```

> *Note: The native version of this application does not run automatically with Docker, as setup instructions differ depending on the operating system.*

I have not deployed the project; the only way to access it is to run it locally. Feel free to contribute to the code, especially since there are likely bugs, particularly when running on Android, as I have mainly tested it on iOS emulators (since I use a Mac) :)
