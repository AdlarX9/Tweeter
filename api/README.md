# Tweeter API

Tweeter API is an API that works with the other two modules in this repository. It handles the backend for both, providing a messaging system inspired by the famous Twitter, where users can write, read, and delete messages in real-time.

It relies on Node.js for the server, Express to manage various requests, Socket.io for real-time communication, and MongoDB for the database.

If you would like to improve the API, I am completely open to contributions, so feel free to get involved!
